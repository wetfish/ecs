## Sensorserial for NodeMCU dev board (ESP8266) and a computer running python scripts

If using Arduino IDE to program microcontroller, rename src/main.cpp to sensorserial.ino

Connect microcontroller that is running sensorserial program to a computer via USB. On the computer, run get_data_from_mcu.py to generate a log file from the microcontroller's sensor readings.
